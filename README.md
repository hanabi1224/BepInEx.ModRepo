# BepInEx.ModRepo
A mono mods repo for the BepInEx.ModManager tool

- Simply add zip archivess of prebuilt mod to ./prebuilt/\<steam-game-id\>/ directory
- once the change is merged into main branch, it will be published automatically 
- Then it will be downloaded automatically in the BepInEx.ModManager client and an upgrade button will show up for the mod if that steam game is installed.
